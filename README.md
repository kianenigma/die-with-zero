## How It Works

The planner calculates year-by-year projections of your net worth based on:
- Income (with growth rate)
- Expenses (with inflation)
- Tax rates (can change by year)
- Asset appreciation rates
- Additional one-time or recurring expenses

When savings are positive, they're distributed proportionally across liquid assets. When negative (expenses exceed income), liquid assets are sold proportionally to cover the shortfall.
